# Campus-Dining-Insights-Temporal-Visual-Analytics-of-Swipe-Data-for-Operational-Planning
This project analyses campus dining swipe data to understand how usage changes across timeâ€”by hour, weekday, and semester. Using temporal visual analytics, the project identifies predictable peaks and quiet periods. The visualizations help dining managers adjust staffing, students plan visits, and operations forecast resources.
