# Campus-Dining-Insights-Temporal-Visual-Analytics-of-Swipe-Data-for-Operational-Planning
This project analyses campus dining swipe data to understand how usage changes across timeâ€”by hour, weekday, and semester. Using temporal visual analytics, the project identifies predictable peaks, quiet periods, and special-event spikes. The visualizations help dining managers adjust staffing, students plan visits, and operations forecast resources. Together, the visuals turn routine swipe counts into clear insights that guide daily and long-term dining decisions.
This project builds upon the temporal analysis developed earlier in the semester, which explored how dining activity changes over time across the academic year. The primary goal is to understand these behavioral cycles and communicate them through clear, data-driven visualizations. By focusing on time-based patterns, this work connects short-term usage trends with larger semester-level rhythms to support dining operations, planning, and decision-making.
The earlier project revealed that campus dining follows a familiar academic rhythm, with strong demand at the start of semesters, moderate levels through mid-term, and clear declines during breaks. The current phase refines those findings and presents them as well-designed temporal visuals supported by data aggregation and contextual annotation. These insights directly help managers forecast staffing, students plan their dining times, and university operations make resource decisions aligned with real campus behavior.
